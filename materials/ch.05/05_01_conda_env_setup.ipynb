    "# Conda Environment Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing conda environments is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and isolation of dependencies for different projects. This guide walks you through the key steps in creating, activating, managing, and saving conda environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a high-level overview of the steps involved in managing conda environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[Create Conda Environment] --> B[Activate the Environment]\n",
    "    B --> C[Install Packages]\n",
    "    C -->|Update YAML & TXT| D[Save the Environment into YAML]\n",
    "    D --> E[Install Additional Packages]\n",
    "    E --> F[Update Environment YAML & requirements.txt]\n",
    "    F --> G[Environment Discrepancy between YAML and Current Status]\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Steps with Conda Commands\n",
    "1. **Create Conda Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Create a new conda environment with a specific name (e.g., `myenv`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda create --name myenv python=3.11\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Activate the Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Activate the newly created environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda activate myenv\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Install Packages**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Install necessary packages within the environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda install numpy pandas scikit-learn\n",
    "    pip install xgboost\n",
    "    ```   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Save the Environment into YAML File**\n",
    "    Export the environment to a YAML file for later use or sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env export > environment.yml\n",
    "    ```  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Update the Environment with YAML file**\n",
    "    It's important to note that the real status of the environment and the saved YAML file might differ over time due to additional installations or updates. This discrepancy allows flexibility and the ability to <u>***roll back***</u> to a previous state by using the saved YAML file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env update -f environment.yml --prune\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "| Feature                   | Without `--prune`                             | With `--prune`                                         |\n",
    "|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Package Addition          | Adds new packages listed in the YAML file     | Adds new packages listed in the YAML file              |\n",
    "| Package Removal           | Does not remove any packages not listed in YAML| Removes packages not listed in the YAML file           |\n",
    "| Package Version Updates   | Updates packages to versions specified in YAML| Updates packages to versions specified in YAML         |\n",
    "| Environment Consistency   | *May leave some packages that are no longer needed* | **Ensures environment matches exactly what's in YAML**     |\n",
    "| Use Case                  | When you want to add or update packages but keep any additional packages installed separately | When you want to ensure the environment strictly follows the YAML file |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create Conda Environment with YAML**\n",
    "    If YAML is shared like the case of our course, conda environment can be created with yml file.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "    ``` "
